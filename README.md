# Simple Terminal File Explorer

This project is a basic terminal file explorer for Linux, designed for quick and efficient browsing of directories. It eliminates the need for multiple tedious `cd` commands to navigate to the desired directory. 

## Installation
Make sure you are using a linux 64-bit machine using .bashrc shell

Download the folder in this repo named "install".
Run the setup.sh script as written in the readme.md of the "install" folder.
This installation script should already set up everything need.

## Usage

To navigate through the directories, use the up and down arrow keys. To move up or down in the directory structure, use the left or right arrow keys. To exit in the selected directory press "enter". To quit the application, simply press 'q'.

## Design Philosophy

This project was designed primarily for learning purposes. As such, I chose to use more "low-level" libraries instead of abstract terminal-GUI libraries. This repo could serve as a project example for someone new to rust looking for simple project ideas.

## Code

The code for this project is written in Rust, a language known for its performance and memory safety features.
